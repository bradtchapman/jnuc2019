Presentation Materials for "2019: APNS + MDM: a Technical Update for Elite Squadrons of Mac Administrators"

Thank you so much for your interest in my Session at JNUC 2019!  Here are direct links to the session as it was presented at JNUC, followed by the keynote deck, a copy of the slides as PDFs including selected stills from the movies played during the presentation.  Finally, you can re-watch the intro in the original theatrical cut, or watch the never-before-seen director's cut with drone footage of post-apocalyptic Minneapolis and more.
